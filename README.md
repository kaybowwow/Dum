## Design -

1) Upon running the program, we prompt the user using a for loop for whether they need any help. This way they can get help / create multiple tickets. 

2) Users are then told to write their name if they said they needed help. Otherwise the program stops. 

3) Users place their problem within a category. We then use this to assign priority.

4) Users wait their turn for a solution and step 1 is repeated.


## Extras
1) The ticket's toString() allows the ticket to be displayed by the terminal as an actual ticket with the user's name, description, ticket number, and priority.

2) We make the user choose which kind of problem they have, making prioritizing easier.

3) Added non-user tickets to the arrayPriorityQueue to simulate an actual help desk center.
