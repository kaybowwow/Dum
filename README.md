# Dum

Design -

1) Upon running the program, we prompt the user using a for loop for whether they need any help. This way they can get help / create multiple tickets. 

2) Users are then told to write their name if they said they needed help. Otherwise the program stops. 

3) Users place their problem within a category. We then use this to assign priority.

4) Users wait their turn for a solution and step 1 is repeated.
